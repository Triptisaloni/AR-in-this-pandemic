# AR-in-this-pandemic
There are three things AR does very well: visualization, annotation and storytelling;
There are examples in each of these areas that are both timely in the current reality of COVID-19 and which can be built upon once cultural institutions, schools and workplaces reopen their doors;
From enabling online learning to opening access to cultural events and experiences, applications of AR and VR could help us overcome the isolation of COVID-19 lockdowns.
Augmented Reality (AR) enables digital information to be superimposed and integrated into our physical environment. With many of us now at home during a global pandemic, AR is a tool that can help us transform our immediate surroundings into learning, work and entertainment spaces.

One thing is certain: AR is no longer just about the technology; it’s about defining how we want to live in the real world with this new technology and how we will design experiences that are meaningful and can enrich humanity.

1. Visualization:
AR is a powerful visualization tool. It allows you to bring an object or concept into a reality that is otherwise imagined, inaccessible or difficult to grasp, and can even help to make the invisible visible. With classrooms closed around the world, educators are moving to online learning models. All 185 first-year medical students at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) are using HoloLens and HoloAnatomy, an award-winning AR app by CWRU and Cleveland Clinic, to learn from their own homes. HoloAnatomy helps students learn about the human body in ways not otherwise possible. With access to the minutest details of the human anatomy in 3D, students’ learning is not limited by the availability of cadavers for dissection or 2D medical textbook illustrations.

2. Annotation:
Annotation with AR helps guide you through the completion of a task, navigate a new environment or even provide real-time descriptions of what’s happening around you.
Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens and mobile devices enables cross-distance collaboration by sharing a live view with experts for assistance. Experts can directly annotate what you are looking at to guide you through a process. Previously used in the workplace for field service repairs and training, remote assist scenarios can be extended to emergencies in remote locations where an expert, such as a medical professional, may not be readily available.

3. Storytelling
AR makes new modes of storytelling and creative expression possible with experiences unfolding in both our homes and public spaces. Introducing new and alternate perspectives, it changes the way we tell, share and even remember stories.

In February 2020, The Los Angeles Times partnered with Yahoo News, media company RYOT and artist Micah 404 to create an AR experience exploring iconic Oscars dresses from the past five decades. With the indefinite postponement of events like the Met Gala 2020 (the annual fundraising gala for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York City) and its corresponding exhibition, AR could provide a way to bring the experience to your home by viewing and even virtually trying-on costumes from the exhibit.
